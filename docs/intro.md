# Introduction

ErgoNation is an open source community-driven project to create a list of addresses, each signifying a unique person. ErgoNation strives to create a protocol that proves both the **humanness and uniqueness** of its participants, while not collecting any personally identifiable  information.


## Why?

"One person, one vote." This is easy to achieve using centralized, non-anonymous mechanisms like nation states distributing IDs and KYC protocols. However, this is hard to achieve in an anonymous, decentralized way. Therefore, the majority of crypto projects uses tokens for governance, which conceptually resemble stock shares and corporate governance, which follows the credo "more investment, more voting power." Ergo Nation tries to bring the concept "one person, one vote" in an anonymous and decentralized way to the Ergo community. Projects can then use the Ergo Nation database to create an electoral list for free.
