# Introduction

ErgoNation is an open source community-driven project to create a list of addresses, each signifying a unique person. ErgoNation strives to create a protocol that proves both the **humanness and uniqueness** of its participants, while not collecting any personally identifiable  information.

## Why?

"One person, one vote." This is easy to achieve using centralized, non-anonymous mechanisms like nation states distributing IDs and KYC protocols. However, this is hard to achieve in an anonymous, decentralized way. Therefore, the majority of crypto projects uses tokens for governance, which conceptually resemble stock shares and corporate governance, which follows the credo "more investment, more voting power." Ergo Nation tries to bring the concept "one person, one vote" in an anonymous and decentralized way to the Ergo community. Projects can then use the Ergo Nation database to create an electoral list for free.

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
