# Use Cases and Reputation

In this section we want to provide a short overview of ideas suggesting how ErgoNation’s ID system - ΣID, can be utilized. ΣID can be used when a project or a community needs or wants to access  uniquely identifyable community members. The possibilities of using ΣID are limited only by the creativity and imagination of projects and the Ergo community. Following are some common use cases:
- **major governance decisions** such as voting on improvement proposals, or budget spending decisions. The ΣIDs can also be used in combination with governance tokens (approval from community AND investors).
- **minor governance decisions** such as verification decisions for tokens and pools on a DEX or NFT collections on market places.
- **testing** of new products and protocols.
- **distribution** of rewards and tokens (airdrops, to gain attention, or spreading, for decentralization such as mixer token wants to do)
- **whitelisting** for token sales or NFT projects

Depending on the use-case it may be important to choose the right subgroup of ΣIDs, to achieve the best results. Hence, utilizers of ErgoNation might want to think about useful filtering criteria to identify people that fit their application. Again, the possibilities for filters are only limited by one’s imagination and the number of available ΣIDs. Nevertheless, we want to provide some examples: 
- **long-term community members:** filter with respect to earliest event completion, for example, all IDs that completed an event before 01.08.2022
- **dedicated community members:** filter with respect to amount of event completions, for example, all IDs that completed at least ΣID verification 10 events
- **recently active community members:** filter with respect to event completions in the recent past, for example, all IDs that completed at least one event in the last three months
- **knowledgeable and interested community members:** filter with respect to type and number of votes participated, e.g., all ΣIDs that participated in at least five votings related to defi protocols
- **community members who share specific values:** filter with respect to past voting decisions, for example, all ΣIDs that voted for option A in the vote about the treasury of project X
- **ensure uniqueness:** filter with respect to ΣID verification event completion ratio over a given time horizon, for example, all IDs that completed at least five of six events between 01.06.2022 and 31.12.2022



All examples above show how reputation (voting and participation history) can be used to generate a list of ΣIDs that fits a specific purpose. Many of these filters can be combined. Projects are responsible to decide whether and in which way they want to filter. Furthermore, they should check whether their filter criteria provide them with enough ΣIDs for their purpose. If projects are left with too few ΣIDs, or when people whose ΣIDs were chosen, do not have an interest in the project, projects can and should invite people from their community to participate in ErgoNation ΣID verification events and help organize them.
