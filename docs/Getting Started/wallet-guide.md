# Wallet Guide

## Recommendedations

Create a new wallet with only one address, which will remain dedicated to ErgoNation.

## Alternatives

Many prefer to use as few wallets as possible. This section explains how one can participate in ErgoNation with multiple addresses, one of which will be used as the ΣID. 

The address used as the ΣID must received funds mixed with **[Ergo Mixer](https://github.com/ergoMixer/ergoMixBack/releases)**. Care must be taken to prevent transactions between other wallet addresses from interacting with the ΣID address. 

*Guides to wallets that can currently be used to hold multiple addresses, including the ΣID:*

### Ergo Wallet/Aneta Wallet (Mobile)

#### Creation
Create a new address in your wallet, which will only be used in ErgoNation. To avoid confusion, we recommend giving the address a name such as, "ErgoNation ID." This address will be your ΣID.

#### Funding
Fund with the **[Ergo Mixer](https://github.com/ergoMixer/ergoMixBack/releases)** to ensure anonymity.

#### Participation in ErgoNation Events
When participating in ErgoNation verification events or votint, it is imporant to only send funds from the unique address created above. 

#### Transactions unrelated to Ergonation
We recommend that the ΣID address is deleted from the wallet, during the time between Ergo Nation events and votes. The wallet will no longer display the ΣID wallet address or funds, but the address still remains on the blockchain and can be restored.
To do this click the three dots next to the address name in the address list and select "Remove."
Before participating in the next event add the ΣID address back into the wallet. 

### SAFEW (Browser Extention)

#### Creation
Start by enabling Expert Mode in the SAFEW settings, and create a new **account** in your wallet. This account will only be used with ErgoNation. The first address within this account will be your ΣID.

#### Funding
Fund this address with **[Ergo Mixer](https://github.com/ergoMixer/ergoMixBack/releases)** to ensure anonymity.

#### Participation in ErgoNation Events
When participating in ErgoNation verification events or voting, only send funds from the ΣID address and ensure that any returned assets (change) returns to the same address. To do this you must select the ΣID address as the "Change Address" in the "edit wallet" settings. 

To send funds only from your ΣID address you need to check only this address, while unchecking all other addresses in the **send tab**. 

After participation has finished, we recommend changing your Change address to an address from a different account, not containing your ΣID.


#### Transactions unrelated to Ergonation
Do not send funds or recieve change from your ΣID address. Go into the "edit wallet" settings and set an address from another account as the Change Address. To avoid sending funds from your ΣID address, uncheck this address from your send tab.

#### The Satergo none wallet will integrate the features to enable participation in ErgoNation with a multi-purpose wallet in its next release.
