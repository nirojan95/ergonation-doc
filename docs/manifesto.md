# Manifesto

The internet democratized access to information and communication at a scale previously unseen, but at a cost. Power concentrated to a few megacorporations who host all the cloud infrastructure, own all our data and control what we see. 

We are more connected, productive and innovative; but at the cost of our privacy, autonomy and freedom. An Orwellian surveillance state looms that milks our attention for profits, while maintaining control through coercion. The problem is twofold the centralization of authority and the resultant loss of personal autonomy.

Systems must be built that maintain a balance of power, while maintaining individual privacy and autonomy.


## Why Ergo Nation?

Ergo Nation strives to preserve the right to anonymity, while maintaining the tenants of democracy where one person gets one vote, giving equal access to all to collaborate and make community decisions.

### Unique On-chain Identity

Privacy protects the individual from society. Financial and personal privacy must be accessible in a free society. Privacy is necessary for freedom of speech and for people to make decisions without the fear of coercion. 

### One Person, One Vote

A democratic society needs to be free for all to take part in, no matter oneâ€™s socioeconomic background.
