# Manifesto

The internet democratized access to information and communication at a scale previously unseen, but at a cost. Power concentrated to a few megacorporations who host all the cloud infrastructure, own all our data and control what we see. An Orwellian surveillance state looms that milks our attention for profits, while maintaining control through coercion. The centralization of authority leads to the loss of individual autonomy.

The people have become willing citizens of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter. They control what is seen, heard and said. 

We may be more connected, productive and innovative; but at the cost of our privacy, autonomy and freedom. 

>> #### Privacy protects the individual from society.

Financial and personal privacy must be accessible in a free society. Privacy is necessary for freedom of speech and for people to make decisions without the fear of coercion.

>> #### Privacy is necessary but not sufficient for a free society.

New governance token models in Web 3.0 may be more private, but they result in plutocracies, where power concentrates towards the wealthy.  No matter how fair governance token distribution is, over time the tokens are accumulated by wealthier stakeholders. Those with a higher stake have a higher incentive to buy governance power and shape the rules of the platform in their own favor.

Governance by the wealthy leads to centralization. The wealthy influence the network to maximally benefit themselves, resulting in institutions similar to those in traditional governance and finance. A system where money buys influence over ‘democratic’ processes. The only difference is that traditional governance at the very least pretends to have equal power distribution with a “one person one vote” system.

Systems must be built that maintain a balance of power, while maintaining individual privacy and autonomy.


## Why Ergo Nation?

Ergo Nation strives to create a list of addresses composed of unique people, while conserving their privacy.

### Unique On-chain Identity

The on-chain identity is a pseudonym that is never linked to the true identity of a community member. It protects the individual from harassment and coercion.

### One Person, One Vote

Democratic governance systems need to be open for all to take part equally, no matter one’s socioeconomic background. 

### Freedom of Speech 

Everybody should have the freedom to say what they want with. The free movement of ideas  

### Airdrops

A list of unique individuals can help projects have fair launches, protecting against botting and the use of multiple accounts.

### Decentralized Global Network

A system that empowers all regular people who want to take part, while preserving their privacy.
